# **Overview**
The Artsource Global enable people to rent art directly from local artists. Most art rental companies buy artwork, rent it out and keep all the money. A website has been built by a previous team. The layout, interaction logic, and related 
functions, interfaces of the page are still very crude. 
The purpose of this team is to build a direct platform between artists and customers, who are eager to rent or buy artworks, thereby revolutionizing artists' existing channel of income stream and the market general rule. To be more precise, Our task is to improve it, find and correct potential bugs, and enrich the usability to promote the user experience that make it professional.
