# **Artsource Global- A TechLauncher Project**

<div align=center><img width="150" height="150" src="/ASG_logo.png"/></div>

# **Overview**
Soon to be rebranded as Remarkable Art, Artsource Global is a platform designed to help local artists connect with those who would be interested in renting their art- hopefully allowing them to achieve a more stable income and exposure in their local communities. In its current form the business exists through it's owner and our client (Jill) manually connecting prospective renters with artists, however in order for the project to scale and become more accessible it will require a strong web presence. We have inhereted a base website from the previous techlauncher team, however the site has very few features and has several major flaws in the structure of its implementation; there is a lot of work for us to do before it's ready to use!
