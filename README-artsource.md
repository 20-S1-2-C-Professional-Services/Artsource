## Introduction

Artsource Global enables people to rent art direct from local artists. Main target are large corporate business' with board rooms, meeting rooms and entrance foyers. 

Our strategy is to create an alternative income stream for artists (their current main income stream being the sale of their art through exhibition). We intend to revolutionise the way an artist makes a living by connecting artists with people who want to rent their artwork. 

We worked with students last year developing an online platform. We would like to review and test this booking system and then launch it within Canberra. Students will be able to then determine the most appropriate additional functionality to work on if possible. We would love to work on an app that allows people to see where the art is being displayed publicly, or there are other options that students will be able to discuss and prioritise.

We are looking for art loving techies that see the value of helping us change the world for the good of artists. We had a fantastic group last year who believed in our start up and created a great beginning. We look forward to looking forward to working with a new group of students this year.

## Stakeholders

Our stakeholder, aka client is Jill Bruce, who comes up with an idea to make a
tight connection between art sellers and artists to decrease the expense of artists
on selling arts. Her idea is similar to the Airbnb, a house rental website, which is
a successful website to help house owner rent their houses without spending
much on advertisement.
